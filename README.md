cis 4210 hci final project Observe+


This project has 9 different technical implementations which each independently have code that can be run locally to visualize the intended purpose. AI had help in organizing the calendar and appointment creation/deletion formatting as well as for helping understand what react tools would be best for a dropdown for react-native-dropdown-picker. Each indivdual branch can be run by itself to showcase how each different section of the project has a technical and feasible implementation.
